# Web Components

## Summary

This project documents my learning process of [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components), the idea of this journey is to get better understanding of how custom elements works in modern javascript framework and to recreate it's functionality without using any framework (just plain and boring HTML, CSS, and JS).
